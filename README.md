# BIOS26120-Fall2017-ZepengMu
This is a repo for all the scripts written by myself used in the final project of BIOS26120 Fall 2017 at UChicago

## 01_chrCount.sh
This is used to count the number of variants in .vcf file on each chromosome.

## 02_chrDistribution.R
This reads in the output of the first script and plot the distribution of variants on chromosomes in a pie chart.

## 03_qualDistribution.R
This plots the quality distribution of all the genotyped variants, which led to the identification of HQ220 and HQ30 sets in my report.

## 04_annovar.R
This does most of the functional analyses the output of ANNOVAR in HQ220 set.

## 05_codonPosition.R
This analysis the distribution of variants in three-letter codons, to varify that snynonymous mutations are more frequent at the third position.

## report.tex
The source code for typeset the final report.
